🔥 PPG Industry Talk 🔥

On 20th November 2025, I was given the golden opportunity to attend my first industry talk in UTM. The industry talk was delivered by PPG, a company specialised in providing paints, coatings and specialty materials to most, if not all, manufacturers in the world. The talk was about how their IT Department keeps the business running through 3 core teams:

- 👨‍💻Data Analytics Department: This department is responsible for making important, data-driven decisions for the company for long-term planning. It is this department that helps to gather, analyse and infer the relationships between all complex, unstructured data from all other departments to maintain business prosperity.
- ☁️ Global IT Infrastructure: This department helps to create, manage and provide cloud computing and cloud services to all of PPG’s operations. Since PPG has many branches established across the entire world, this department is responsible for ensuring smooth and open information flow between all branches. 
- 🔄 SAP Team: This department’s main responsibility is to design and manage information systems such as the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system created for PPG operations. They coordinate all information systems designed for each business operation or department via a unified information system. 

🤩 Overall, this industry talk has given me some insightful knowledge about how the use of computing and IT is vital for a business’ health and performance. As such, my team and I have designed a simple poster that summarises the industry talk.

Many thanks to my teammates Fakhrul Azmi, Dina Alysa and MALEK ALRIHAWI.
