✍️  Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. Industry Talk 🖊️

On December 18th 2025, I was once again given the golden opportunity by the Faculty of Computing to attend another industry talk titled "Project Management and System Development". The talk was offered by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib, the Head of Technology and Innovation department of Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. The main highlight of this talk was the basic skills of project management and system development.

- 🔥 Mr. Abdul first shared us the definitions and approaches of system development life cycle, a fundamental methodology used to create, design and manage information systems. He explained the differences between the traditional approach of SDLC, which is the "Waterfall" method and the modern approach, which is the "Agile" method. He highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches whilst giving us a practical example to demonstrate the use cases of both methods. He best summarises the importance of SDLC in one quote: "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail".
- 🤖 Then, Mr. Abdul introduced us to agentic coding and empathised its importance in today's world. He believed that almost all computer science jobs requires the applicant to have some knowledge in using artificial intelligence (AI) to assist their work as their productivity is "10x" more than that of the same applicant with the same skillset without knowledge in utilising AI. He recommended us to "stop being a 'coder' and start being a 'system architect', managing the AI to build the system for us". 
-‼️Before ending the industry talk, Mr. Abdul also mentioned the risks of not knowing how to manage and control the output of AI when it comes to designing critical systems vital to a business' health. He used one real-life work example to demonstrate the disastrous and adverse effects of not reviewing code generated by the AI towards the business' outcome. 

As a conclusion, this industry talk was a big inspiration for us to keep an open-mind when it comes to learning basic computer science skills. I have realised that employers nowadays not only look for good programming skills in an applicant, but also skills that can boost their productivity like agentic coding and system development and project management skills. As part of our assignment, we have written a 3-page report summarising the contents of the industry talk. Many thanks to my teammates Fakhrul Azmi, Dina and Malek Alrihawi.
