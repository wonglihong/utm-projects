🔥 Biocon Industry Visit 🧪



On December 23rd 2025, for the first time in my entire life, I visited a big industry to observe and study about how their IT operations work in the company. The industry was called Biocon, which is the largest insulin manufacturer in the entire Asia continent. It was an exciting opportunity for me as I got to learn how computing is used in a large industry to ensure business prosperity.



- 🔬 During the industry visit, we were given the rare chance to experience first-hand how they produce their insulin. We had to wear special suits to not contaminate the environment that is vital to produce the insulin. We saw there were specific machines with an interface attached to it to control the manufacturing process. 

- 🤖 There were many departments and phases the insulin manufacturing process must go through before it is packaged into the final product. We visited many specialised areas for researching the insulin, many of which utilises computers to analyse the data gathered from the analysis. These data containing information about their products are routinely backed up by the IT department to minimise the effects of data loss.  

-‼️We noticed the workplace was enforced with very strict protocols and work ethics. These enforcement were carried out to ensure the workplace environment is conducive for conducting laboratory researches about their insulin products. As such, there were some prohibited places we were not allowed to enter as our physical presence can alter the conducive conditions of the environment itself.  



In toto, this industry visit was very valuable to me as I got to understand how the use of computers can be used to not only form a company's information systems, but also can be used to regulate and control the vital manufacturing processes of a company. This has galvanised me to further appreciate the benefits of computing towards a company's success. As part of our assignment, we have written a 3-page newsletter summarising the contents of the industry visit. Many thanks to my teammates: Fakhrul Azmi, Dina Alysa and MALEK ALRIHAWI.
