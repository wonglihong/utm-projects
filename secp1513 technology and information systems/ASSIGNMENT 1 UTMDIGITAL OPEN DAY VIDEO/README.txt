🔥 Face-to-face industry talk session



On 29th October 2025, as part of our assignment for the Technology and Information System course we have to take in our first year Bachelor’s degree, I had the golden opportunity to listen to an industry talk hosted by one of the head of departments of the UTMDigital, which is the department responsible for providing digital services to everyone studying at UTM. 🤩



- 🙌🏻 The industry talk was titled “System Development”. During the talk, the speaker, Helmee Bin Yaacob, gave us some insightful information on the types of approach to develop an efficient digital system, particularly the agile approach which involves constant communication and updates between the system developers and the clients to ensure a smooth and accurate delivery of the final product. 

- ⚙️ To further enhance our understanding, Dr Helmee also used suitable examples, such as the system development journey of the UTMSMART mobile application to demonstrate how the agile approach helped the developers to successfully complete the development of the mobile application itself. 

- 😄 I had the golden opportunity to ask and interview Dr Helmee some questions regarding the industry talk given. 



‼️The most unforgettable moment when I interviewed him was this:



Me: Dr Helmee, what’s one important piece of advice you would give to everyone who’s job is in the IT field?

Dr Helmee: The most important thing is to be happy at what you do.



✅✅✅ I strongly agree with his opinion, because when we are happy at whatever we do, we are more likely to enjoy dealing with the problems associated with our tasks, hence motivating us further to continue doing what we love in the long run.



Overall, this industry talk was very beneficial to me as I gained some new knowledge in terms of developing a system through a systematic approach that prioritises constant communication between the client and the developers. I hope that our Faculty of Computing can host more industry talks for us computer scientist students to master the basics and fundamentals of computer science. 😎
